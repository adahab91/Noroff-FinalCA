        <p class="[ toggle__content--text ]">Each players starts the game with 20 life. Knock your opponent down to 0 life, and you win. The most common way to do this is to summon creatures and attack with them.</p>
        <p class="[ toggle__content--text ]">Creature cards are the most important of many Something decks. Theyre really easy to spot--just look at the lower right of a card. If you see a pair of numbers seperated by a stash youve got a creature card. Once its on the battlefield, a creature continues to attack and defend for you until your opponent can find a way to take it out.</p>
        <p class="[ toggle__content--text ]">Most games become a race to see who can deal with most damage first. Summoning the best creatures would help you win that race every time. Check out the section on casting creature spells.</p>
